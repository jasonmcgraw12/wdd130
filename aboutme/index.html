            My name is Jason McGraw and I come from a family of 8 and they're all really great people. Two of my brothers are here with me at BYUI which I'm really greatful for since I can go to them with any questions I might have. I love playing piano, drawing and gaming (who doesn't) although I just recently got into drawing. I'm excited to learn more about coding and making websites, it's kina weird that I get so excited about that stuff, but that's who I am. I hope anyone reading this has a great day!
